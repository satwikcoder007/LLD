Inheritance: It is a mechanism in which a class inherit the property of  another class. the class which inherit is called subclass
             and from where it got inherited is called super class

+points:  1. This result in code reusability.
          2. it forms a hierarchical relationship among classes

-points:  1.not flexible
          2.the design is strongly coupled

Composition: Composition is a technique  in which a classes are formed by composing different classes.

+points: 1.Provide flexibility
         2.Create loosely coupled design
         3.implementation details are encapsulated.

-points: 1.Difficult to design
         2.Performance overhead due to creation of lot of instances.
